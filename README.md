## Configuring 


To start configuring, just add or modify the nix files in `./config`.
If you add a new configuration file, remember to add it to the
[`config/default.nix`](./config/default.nix) file

## Testing your new configuration

To test your configuration simply run the following command

```
nix run .
```
# MyNixvim


This is my first public repo and i may or may not have stolen bits of code here an there.

Should work if you have nix configured correctly.
```
nix run github:Meliketoaste/MyNixvim
```
